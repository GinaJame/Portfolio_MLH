    <h1>About</h1>
    <p class="about-container">
      I am studying B.S. Computer Science and Technology at the Instituto Tecnol√≥gico de Monterrey.
      I am interested in cybersecurity, web development, production engineeering and
      mobile development. My passion is to learn new things and in my free time I like to play the violin, read,
      watch Netflix and hanging out with my friends.
